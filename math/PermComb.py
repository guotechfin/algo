#pseudo code recursive way???

#from the sequence of permutations for n âˆ’ 1
#by placing the number n into each possible position in each of the shorter permutations.

# recursive permutation solution is inefficient,
# another view of generating all permutations is
# like a journey from 123456789 to 987654321
# every neighour nodes throught the path just diff one bit,
# our algorithm is
# to find the next permutation according lexicographic order directly
# for example, if you can guess next permutation of 912758643 is
# 912763458, then you can understand the following algorithm

###
#base state: 3 is smaller than 4, 
#but our next phase should be a little bigger, so swap 3,4
#1234-->1243 

# usage:
# nextPerm([1,4,3,2])
